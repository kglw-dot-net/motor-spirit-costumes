# [Motor Spirit Costumes](https://kglw-dot-net.github.io/motor-spirit-costumes/)

...brought to you by [@billabongvalleybootleg] & [KGLW.net]!

This is a single-page-site which lets a visitor customize the "Motor Spirit" costume package designed by @billabongvalleybootleg.

The site is scaffolded by [Gatsby] but isn't really using any of its features. The image composition uses the JavaScript [Canvas API]. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages.
